For non-musicians (like me), this command line utility was created to provide scale and 
chord info. For example, for a given key and mode, eg. Eb Aeolian, it will list the 
notes in the scale and the main seven triad chords:

    (1) Aeolian scale: Eb F Gb Ab Bb B Db

          i  Ebm   (Eb-Gb-Bb)
         ii  Fdim  (F-Ab-B)
        III  Gb    (Gb-Bb-Db)
         iv  Abm   (Ab-B-Eb)
          v  Bbm   (Bb-Db-F)
         VI  B     (B-Eb-Gb)
        VII  Db    (Db-F-Ab)

You can also use it to identify scales that use particular chords. For example, you might 
want to know what scales use the chords Eb, Gm and Fm:

    (1) Aeolian scale: C D Eb F G Ab Bb

          i  Cm    (C-Eb-G)
         ii  Ddim  (D-F-Ab)
        III  Eb    (Eb-G-Bb)
         iv  Fm    (F-Ab-C)
          v  Gm    (G-Bb-D)
         VI  Ab    (Ab-C-Eb)
        VII  Bb    (Bb-D-F)

    (2) Ionian scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D

          I  Eb    (Eb-G-Bb)
         ii  Fm    (F-Ab-C)
        iii  Gm    (G-Bb-D)
         IV  Ab    (Ab-C-Eb)
          V  Bb    (Bb-D-F)
         vi  Cm    (C-Eb-G)
        vii  Ddim  (D-F-Ab)

It's just an experimental thing that was developed in Visual Studio 2017.
